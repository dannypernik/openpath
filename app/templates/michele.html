        a test prep coach dedicated to empowering students to discover their true
        capabilities. While I've worked with kids in various capacities my entire adult
        life, I started tutoring in 2009 to bring in extra income while homeschooling my
        children. What began as a way to support my family soon became my calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tutoring practice has evolved over the years: in 2017, I started exclusively
        tutoring online, and in 2020, I began to focus solely on test prep.
      </p>
      <p>
        What has remained constant throughout the evolution of my career has been my
        dedication to my students. While the content of what I teach has varied over the
        years, I consistently devote myself to helping my students recognize and live up
        to their fullest potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach goes beyond teaching the materialâ€”I strive to understand each
        student's unique needs, and then tailor strategies that work for them while
        cheering them on each step of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teaching my students to tackle challenges head-on builds their confidence so they
        can achieve higher scores that will help them open the doors to their dreams.
