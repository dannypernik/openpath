        Since 2015, I've had the privilege of working with hundreds of students to help
        them substantially increase grades and test scores, strengthen confidence in and
        out of the classroom, and get accepted into some of the most selective and
        prestigious universities in the country.
      </p>

        I love to tutor. I really enjoy getting to connect one-on-one with students more
        as a peer than as an authority figure. Prior to Open Path Tutoring, I worked for
        two national test prep companies. I gained valuable perspective regarding not only
        the variety of test prep strategies but also the subtle art of building trust and
        rapport with high schoolers. Students tend to be more receptive to ideas or
        feedback when I share them than when a parent or teacher shares them. I feel
        fortunate to be given the opportunity to connect meaningfully with so many
        fantastic teenagers.

        I love to explore and support ideas to change the world. Open Path Tutoring is the
        third entrepreneurial journey I've embarked upon since 2011. I love to explore
        ideas that forge new connections within communities and make the world a better
        place. I previously cofounded an organization called openCurrents that aimed to
        provide a living wage to volunteers of nonprofits through digital currency.
        Nonprofits issued 1 "Current" to volunteers for each hour worked, and businesses
        in the community gave discounts to volunteers in exchange for Currents.

        I love to spend time with my family, play soccer, and grow my spiritual connection.
        Online tutoring has allowed me to spend more time with my son Ember
        and daughter Zeta as they grow up. It brings challenges too, of course,
        but I welcome the opportunity to grow. My kids are a long way from college,
        but when they start test prep, I will find them a tutor too. I know better
        than to expect them to listen to me!
