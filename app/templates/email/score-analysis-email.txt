Hi {{ parent.first_name }}, thank you for requesting your student's practice test score analysis. I will be out of town from Thurs Feb 1st to Weds Feb 7th, so  I will process the score reports and send them out when I return. Feel free to reply to this address with any questions in the meantime.

Thank you,
Danny
