      Hi {{ user.first_name }}, you're almost there! Here are some suggestions to
      put yourself in the best possible position for the {{ td }}
      {{ test_date.test.upper() }}. You can get started with item #1 today:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Before test day</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Look at your schedule from now until the test to see how you can minimize
          stress in the couple days leading up to the {{ test_date.test.upper() }}.
        </li>
        <li>
          The day before the test, review your subject strategies and notes for key
          concepts, but don't cram practice questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get extra rest the 2 nights before the {{ test_date.test.upper() }}.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Things to bring</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Photo ID</li>
        <li>Admission ticket</li>
        <li>#2 pencils: 2 sharpened, 1 dull</li>
        <li>
          {% if test_date.test == 'sat' %}
            <a href="https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy" target="_blank">
              Approved calculator</a>
          {% elif test_date.test == 'act' %}
            Calculator
          {% endif %}
          with new batteries
        </li>
        <li>Watch with alarm setting turned off</li>
        <li>Snacks and drink for break time</li>
        <li>Extra layer of clothing</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>During the test</strong>
      <li>
        Plan to arrive by 7:45am, especially if you have never been to the testing
        center. You may be denied entry if you arrive after 8:00am.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus over speed. It's better to get through 90% of the questions
        focused than 100% of the questions rushed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the start of each section, visualize yourself using your chosen
        strategies, feeling confident in your answers, and moving easily
        through the test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Find what's familiar. Each {{ test_date.test.upper() }} brings new ways to
        ask questions that cover the same old concepts. Identifying the concept is
        often half the challenge.
      </li>
      <li>
        {% if test_date.test == 'sat' %}
          The SAT usually ends with a 5th experimental section.
          This section does not count toward your score.
        {% elif test_date.test == 'act' %}
          The ACT usually includes a 5th experimental section after Science but
          before the optional essay. This section does not count toward your score.
        {% endif %}
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, remember to trust yourself! You've put in the work to train your
      intuition, and now is your time to use it! If you have any questions, please
      don't hesitate to ask by replying to this email.

      All the best,<br>
