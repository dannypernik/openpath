      Hi {{ user.first_name }}, this is an automated reminder that the regular
      registration deadline for the {{ test_date.test.upper() }} on {{ td }} is coming up
      on {{ reg_dl }}.
      {% if test_date.late_date is not none %}
        Registration after this date until the late registration
        deadline on {{ late_dl }} will incur an additional fee.
      {% endif %}
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have already registered, great job! If you have decided against taking the
      test on this date, reply to this email with your updated plans so that you only
      receive relevant reminders.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the best,<br>
      The Open Path Team
