    Hi {{ user.first_name }}, this is an automated reminder that the regular
    registration deadline for the {{ test_date.test.upper() }} on {{ td }} is coming up
    on {{ reg_dl }}.
    {% if test_date.late_date is not none %}
      Registration after this date until the late registration
      deadline on {{ late_dl }} will incur an additional fee.
    {% endif %}
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have already registered, that's great! Reply to this email so we can update your
    status. If you have decided against taking the test on this date, let us know so that
    you only receive relevant reminders.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the best,<br>
    The Open Path Team
