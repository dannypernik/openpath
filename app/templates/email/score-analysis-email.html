      Hi {{ parent.first_name }}, thank you for requesting the score report for your student's practice test. If you've submitted the request by Monday, Jan 29th, I should be able to get it to you by Wednesday. I will be out of town from Thurs Feb 1st to Weds Feb 7th, so 
      I will process the remaining score reports and send them out when I return. Feel free
      to reply to this address with any questions in the meantime.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you,<br>
      Danny
