Please find the {{ score_data['test_display_name'] }} score report for {{ score_data['student_name'] }} attached.
{% if score_data['missing_data'] %}
It appears that data for the following questions was missing from the Score Details PDF:
{% for item in score_data['missing_data'] %}
  - {{ item['sub'] }} Module {{ item['mod'] }} Question {{ item['q'] }}</li>
{% endfor %}
Answers for these questions will appear as "not found" on the score report. The subject and overall scores are still accurate, however.

{% if score_data['answer_key_mismatches'] %}It appears that the College Board has changed the answer key for practice {{ score_data['test_display_name'] }}. The following questions may display incorrectly on your score report:
{% for obj in score_data['answer_key_mismatches'] %}
{% if obj['sub'] == 'rw_modules' %}R&W module {{ obj['mod'] }}{% if int(obj['mod']) > 1 %}{% if score_data['is_rw_hard'] %}H{% else %}E{% endif %}{% endif %}{% else %}Math module {{ obj['mod'] }}{% if int(obj['mod']) > 1 %}{% if score_data['is_m_hard'] %}H{% else %}E{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endif %} #{{ obj['q'] }}  Expected correct answer: {{ obj['previous_key'] }}  New correct answer: {{ obj['new_key'] }}{% endfor %}

Note that the scores displayed on the report are not affected by errors in the answer key.
