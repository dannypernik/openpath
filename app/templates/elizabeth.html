        Physics doesn't have to feel overwhelming. I specialize in breaking down
        complex ideas into simple, clear concepts through helpful analogies, clear
        visuals, and an infectious passion for learning physics.  Success in physics isn't
        about memorizing lots of formulas. It's about connecting ideas to the real world
        you already know and building confidence one step at a time.
      </p>

        My approach focuses on connecting students' intuition and everyday experiences
        with the language of physics through words, graphs, pictures, and equations. I
        have successfully guided hundreds of students to regain their confidence and get
        back on track with personalized physics tutoring tailored to their individual
        needs. Whether you are working to regain confidence, boost your grades, or push
        for top exam scores, I will guide you through a personalized learning journey that
        makes physics not only manageable but surprisingly enjoyable.
