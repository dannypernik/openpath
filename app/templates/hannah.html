        <span class="h4 fw-bold me-1">Hi there! I'm Hannah,</span>
        a neuroscience graduate and experienced tutor with a passion for helping
        students unlock their potential through personalized, research-backed instruction.
        I hold a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from Baylor University and bring over
        1,500 hours of tutoring experience across subjects ranging from executive
        functioning and math tutoring to essay writing and reading intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic background in cognitive science fuels my work with students who learn
        differently, especially those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and other learning
        challenges. I'm trained in the Orton-Gillingham-based Reading Horizons curriculum
        and specialize in multi-sensory reading intervention for elementary students. I
        also provide executive functioning coachingâ€”helping students build skills in
        organization, time management, prioritization, and goal setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to tutoring, I'm currently engaged in educational research and co-authoring a
        case study on executive functioning intervention.  My work blends behavioral science with
        hands-on support, and I'm passionate about making learning approachable, encouraging, and
        effective for every student.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not teaching or researching, I enjoy writing, hiking, and exploring new ways to
        support students' growth both inside and outside the classroom.
      </p>
