        Danny is fantastic &#8211; he is very able to understand my son's
        strengths, and then focus on areas for development. He has a calm
        and patient way that makes tutoring something my son doesn’t dread!
        He’s very in-tune with my son's interests, and uses that as a basis
        for the learning as much as possible. This helps my son stay engaged
        and interested because he feels understood, and can relate to the
        material. 10/10 would recommend Open Path Tutoring.

        After scoring a 1270 on my PSAT, I was so excited to start at 1400 on my first practice test with Danny. I am thrilled to have achieved my dream score of 1500 and I couldn't have done it without his guidance and support. The diagnostic tests helped to quickly recognise my strengths and weaknesses. This way we were able to focus on what I needed to work on, which boosted my confidence. I really appreciate Danny's patience and expertise.

        Danny tutored my daughter for her SAT and she scored a 1500
        on the test. She was admitted to Northwestern University, Brown University,
        and Boston University, just to mention a few. Danny is such an awesome
        tutor and he has a way of bringing out the best in his students.
        I have referred many of my friends to him and they all have great
        things to say about their children’s experience with Danny. I highly
        recommend Danny to anyone that is looking for a tutoring service for
        their children. You can thank me later after using his services!
        Thank you so much for your help, Danny!

        With Danny’s help as my tutor for the SAT, I was able to achieve a
        1460 on my first attempt. I contacted him again because I wanted
        to improve my score and on my second attempt I was able to achieve
        a score of 1500.

        In addition to helping with my success on the traditional SAT, my
        work with Danny provided me with the framework needed to excel on
        the PSAT as a Junior. I attribute my time with Danny as a crucial
        factor that allowed me to become a National Merit Scholar. As a
        freshman at the University of Florida with aspirations for medical
        school, I am still reaping the numerous benefits provided to me &#8211;
        in terms of scholarships and opportunities &#8211; thanks to my time
        working with him. I am extremely grateful that I was able to have
        Danny as my tutor.

        My son needed to take the ACT early because he was going through
        the college athletic recruiting process. He sometimes has difficulty
        with standardized tests - and does not enjoy studying or test preparations.
        Danny made the tutoring sessions fun and interesting. My son achieved
        an ACT score strong enough for the most selective schools in the country.
        Danny did an incredible job and my son is heading to USC this Fall.

        Danny was recommended to me by a friend whose children and sister’s
        children had been tutored by him for the SAT. I contacted him because
        the students he tutored all got great scores. Danny
        then tutored my daughter and some of my friend’s children. We could
        all not believe how his tutoring improved their scores in the SAT exams.

      <p class="mb-1">
        We are so thankful for his hard work in making sure the children
        did exceptionally well. He cares for his students and makes the exam
        approachable for them without fear but confidence. I will recommend
        his tutoring service for anyone who wants the best for their children.
        He is not only a teacher to us now, but has become a friend.
        Thank you Danny, I know many will benefit greatly from your service.

        Danny tutored me in preparation for the SAT my junior year of high
        school and I only have great things to say about him. He was always
        patient and prepared, providing helpful tools and amazing guidance.
        His services were also very thorough. I went on to use the SAT
        test-taking skills he taught not only on the SAT and ACT but also
        at the University of Pittsburgh. I’m very confident that you will
        be happy working with him!

        I could not have asked for a better tutor than Danny for my SAT.
        With his help, I was able to score a SAT score in the 99th percentile.
        Through his effective ways of teaching and explaining the material,
        I was able to easily learn and retain the information. Thanks to Danny
        I was way more prepared for the exam compared to my peers and, I would
        not hesitate to ask him to be my tutor if I ever need help with
        something again.

        do well on their SATs. Before I came to him I didn’t really know how
        to approach any of the questions but he showed me little tricks and
        methods to ensure I did well.

        Danny is an engaging and patient teacher who is insightful and
        thoughtful. He takes the time to get to know his students so he
        can really understand their needs and personalities. He has helped
        my daughter achieve a strong SAT score - and I’ve noticed her grammar
        and writing skills in everyday life have improved greatly, too. I
        highly recommend Danny.
